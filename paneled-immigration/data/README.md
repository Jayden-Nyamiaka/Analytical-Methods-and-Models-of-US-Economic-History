# Instructions for Data

The data of the USA IPUMS decennial census records from 1900, 1910, and 1920 and the Census Tree Project crosswalks are not included in this repository because the data is too large.

The data in the out folder is the output of the data processing scripts in the src folder. The folder is empty in the repository because the data is too large but the data can be generated by running the scripts in the analysis.ipynb.

The code books for the USA IPUMS census data are included in the data folder and show the variables that are included in the census data. These can be used as a guide to recreate the data extractions.
