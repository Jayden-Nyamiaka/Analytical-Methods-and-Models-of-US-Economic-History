# Analytical-Methods-and-Models-of-US-Economic-History
Advanced analytical methods and computational models to explore over 125 years of U.S. economic history. Combines data-driven analysis, econometrics, and programming to explore key historical phenomena through a software engineering lens.

## Features
- **Data Engineering**: ETL pipelines for processing historical economic datasets using Python.  
- **Econometric Modeling**: Implementation of advanced techniques like complex regressions, difference-in-differences, and instrumental variables in Python.  
- **Visual Insights**: Interactive visualizations and dashboards built with Python libraries for exploring trends and relationships in historical data.  
- **Reproducibility**: Modular and well-documented Python code adhering to software engineering best practices.

## Technologies
- **Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, Plotly  
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebooks, VS Code  

## Structure
